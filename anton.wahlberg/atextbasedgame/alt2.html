          Getting up, patting your body to see you're all right, your mind is
          getting occupied by a whimsical surge of fireflies soaring around your
          body.

          What is this weird place, I've never seen so many fireflies before,
          and definitely not this close to my body. They actually feel pretty
          warm, like they're actually burning. Seems like they're trying to show
          me something, they're forming a line to the path over there..
