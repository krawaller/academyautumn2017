      Climbing is cumbersome. The tree you chose had an extra thick layer
      of moss and your skills have definitely faltered since your youngster

      Wow, this place is amasing, and I can see very far from here, however
      there isn't really anything more than trees, and even more trees on
      top of that. Now I have to get down again somehow...
