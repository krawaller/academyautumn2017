                The water is drinkable, or so they say, but you have trust issues and can't really believe in anything anyone tells you.
            </p>

                What if you drank the water and goit sick? But what if you wont get sick and instead end up saving a lot of money not having to buy any more disgusting bottled water?
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you want to drink the water?
