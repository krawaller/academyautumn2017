        <p class="paragraf"> The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is a single-player adventure
          gamebook written by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, and illustrated by
          Russ Nicholson. Originally published by Puffin Books in 1982, the title is the first
          gamebook in the Fighting Fantasy series. It was later republished by Wizard Books in 2002.
          As well as launching the Fighting Fantasy series,
          the gamebook inspired two direct sequels and five novels,
          and was adapted into a board game and a video game.
