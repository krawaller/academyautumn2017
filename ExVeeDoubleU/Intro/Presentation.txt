Previous experience:

HTML & CSS: Upper secondary school course 'Webbutveckling 1', Attempt at modifying website template @ maxhellqvist.se/maxhellqvist.com.

C#: Game scripting in Unity3D.
JavaScript: Very basic knowledge gained when trying to find game scripting fixes, that I then converted to c#.

What impression has javascript had on me? var, var, var, var, var, functions don't function.
