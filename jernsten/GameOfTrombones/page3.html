                You're out in the woods
            </h2>
            <p>
                You chose to live in the woods because you like being alone and you love the idea that someone could be murdered here without anyone knowing. That someone could be you. Or you could be the murderer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinking of murder made you want for money and wanting for money made you need to get going.
