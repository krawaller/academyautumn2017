                You're watching the Kardashians
            </h2>
            <p>
                You hate the Kardashians but you still watch it, every day. Kim is crying because of no reason. Everytime she cries, she makes more money.

            <p>
                Money. You like money, but you can't make any crying. So you leave the TV behind and put on your shoes, your jacket, and you leave your house.

            <p>
                You're outside your house. Where to go?
