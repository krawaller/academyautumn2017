        <article>
            Once upon a time a boy was offered to take part in a accelerated learning experience arranged by <a href="https://www.academy.se">Academy</a>.<br>
            Our boy could not decide if he would choose the heavenly path of Java Man or follow the C# Devil into a world of darkness which is not platform independent.
        <br><br>
    Well boy - what would you like to do?</article>
